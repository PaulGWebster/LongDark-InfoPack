A collection of information from various sources for the Long Dar

This pack is hopefully had many people throw odds and ends in but its main goal

is to simply make the long dark a little more explorable especially on the 

higher difficulties, on the alpha versions of the long dark it was possible to 

memorise most of the locations, now with the forklong muskeg+ its simply not

at least not for most players!
