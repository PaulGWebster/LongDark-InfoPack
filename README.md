A collection of information from various sources for the Long Dark

## Nomanculture

File types (and what can open them - not exhaustive):

* ods = OpenDocument Format, this can be opened with any recent openoffice, msoffice or office package.

* jpg = Standard image format openable by pretty much everything

* png = Standard image format openable by pretty much everything

* xcf = GIMP / GNU Image Manipulation format file, openable by GIMP only - I think

* pdf = Portable Document Format, most web browsers, foxit, adobe reader

## Community built resources

This pack is hopefully had many people throw odds and ends in but its main goal

is to simply make the long dark a little more explorable especially on the 

higher difficulties, on the alpha versions of the long dark it was possible to 

memorise most of the locations, now with the forklong muskeg+ its simply not

at least not for most players!

This is a plain over view of all primary locations in the game and the connections

between them, not all of them have been verified by my self and I am slowly doing 

so in a layered GIMP file.
