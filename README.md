A collection of information from various sources for the Long Dar

## Community built

This pack is hopefully had many people throw odds and ends in but its main goal

is to simply make the long dark a little more explorable especially on the 

higher difficulties, on the alpha versions of the long dark it was possible to 

memorise most of the locations, now with the forklong muskeg+ its simply not

at least not for most players!

### Master map

This is a plain over view of all primary locations in the game and the connections

between them, not all of them have been verified by my self and I am slowly doing 

so in a layered GIMP file.
