# The Long Dark - Info Pack

A collection of information from various sources for the Long Dark

## Note on commiting

Despite the rather chaotic commit history (with me figuring howto best lay the

directory structure out), please always PR on a nicely named branch.

## Note on layout

This archive is laid out under the dataset/ directory by region and world, anything

that is a global scope will of course be in the world directory, maps for specific

regions will likewise be in the region/region-name directory.

Every section has its own index with what is within it so as to not make this

initial readme to large :) and easily browsable via github

## Notes on journals

If you would like to add in specific notes for specific areas feel free!

Please name your journal after what it is for, for instance if you was writing

about the farmstead in pleasant valley then you would want to name the file:

    farmstead-location-of-cheetos.md(or .txt)

This should be stored in the pleasantvalley folder within 'region', making the

full path be: Region\Pleasant Valley\farmstead-location-of-cheetos.md

If you are feeling upto it you could also adjust the README.md in that directory 

to update you have added your journal and what its about :)
